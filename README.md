Rock paper scissors game - still in the works

This is meant to be a rock paper scissors game that runs in java. It is still in the works and not completed yet, this is an ongoing project.
The part completed so far is the main page. It will have another window where the user will have the choice between pressing rock, paper or scissors and the program will randomly choose one of the three in response and compare the to see who is the winner 

When cloning this be sure that the image rps.png is in the bin folder or it will not run
