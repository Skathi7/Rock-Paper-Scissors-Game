**About**

This is meant to be a rock paper scissors game that runs in Java and uses Swing for the GUI. It has a main page, a Play Game button that takes the user to the next window. On the next window the user can play the game. It will give the user three chooses (rock, paper, scissors) and it will get a random choice from the computer. The program will display both the user's choice and the comptuer's random choice each time the user picks their choice in the game. The user also has the choice to return to the home page on the game window
